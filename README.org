#+TITLE: Introduction to version control with Git and RStudio

There is plenty of material on the web! In particular, you can check out the
[[https://github.com/OpenScienceCourse-JyU-2015/courseMaterial/blob/master/day-02-pm_version-control/version-control-with-git.md][course from the Open Science workshop]].

You will be at ease with Git basics after this session, but not everything can
be taught in less than two hours. The main aim of this session is to give you
an appetite for going further with Git and collaborative R code development!

* A primer with Git, outside RStudio

To get a feeling of how it is to work with Git, let's first do some work
directly in the terminal.

**  Check that Git is installed on your computer

- Open a terminal
- Type:
  #+BEGIN_SRC 
  git --version
  # git version 1.8.3.1
  #+END_SRC
  If you get an error message, install Git!

** Hands-on with Git

- Create a test folder for a dummy project and go there.
- Do the practicals as described in sections 2.3 to 5 in the [[https://github.com/OpenScienceCourse-JyU-2015/courseMaterial/blob/master/day-02-pm_version-control/version-control-with-git.md][Open Science
  course]].

* Using Git with RStudio

We are now going to use Git to version control an R project with RStudio.

** Set up your project

- Let's create a folder =moominland-demography=. This is our project folder.
- RStudio can provide the interface between your R project and Git, but we have
  to tell RStudio where to find Git. Go to =Tools= > =Global options= >
  =Git/SVN= and check the options there.
- You can also check out the [[https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077?version=1.0.136&mode=desktop][links]] provided there.
- Try to set up version control for your project: =Tools= > =Version control= >
  =Project setup=
- RStudio complains: you can only use version control with RStudio for RStudio
  projects. Note that outside RStudio, you can use Git for whatever you want.
- Let's create a new project: =File= > =New project= > =Existing directory= and
  select the =moominland-demography= folder.
- Now you can go back to =Tools= > =Version control= > =Project setup= and
  select =Git= as your version control system.
- Lo and behold, there is a new tab next to the =History= tab!
