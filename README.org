#+TITLE: Introduction to version control with Git and RStudio

There is plenty of material on the web! In particular, you can check out the
[[https://github.com/OpenScienceCourse-JyU-2015/courseMaterial/blob/master/day-02-pm_version-control/version-control-with-git.md][course from the Open Science workshop]].

* A primer with Git, outside RStudio

To get a feeling of how it is to work with Git, let's first do some work
directly in the terminal.

**  Check that Git is installed on your computer

- Open a terminal
- Type:
  #+BEGIN_SRC 
  git --version
  # git version 1.8.3.1
  #+END_SRC
  If you get an error message, install Git!

** Hands-on with Git

- Create a test folder for a dummy project and go there.
- Do the practicals as described in sections 2.3 to 5 in the [[https://github.com/OpenScienceCourse-JyU-2015/courseMaterial/blob/master/day-02-pm_version-control/version-control-with-git.md][Open Science
  course]].

* Using Git with RStudio

We are now going to use Git to version control an R project with RStudio.
